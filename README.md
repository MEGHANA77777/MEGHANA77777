- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m a self-proclaimed tech wizard by day and a space explorer by night (okay, mostly just in my imagination). When I'm not cracking code or solving complex algorithms, I'm probably dreaming up the next intergalactic workout routine for my alien buddy or brainstorming how to save the world through sustainable tech. Also, I once won a district basketball competition, which proves I'm just as good at shooting hoops as I am at coding! 😎🏀✨
